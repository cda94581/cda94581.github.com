What am I supposed to say? Yesterday, I started migrating my old website over to a newer website, with much better everythings overall. Hopefully I actually finish writing this before tomorrow though, it&#39;s 11:29 PM right now.</p><p>Anyway, there&#39;s a ton that I want to do on this new website. A few of the things include:</p><ul><li>A Dedicated Tutorials &amp; Videos Page. I&#39;d love to be able to catalog and document each video, with all the necessary things to know, onto a webpage. I&#39;ll figure out more later on.</li><li>A Community Tab. It would be wonderful to list some things going on in my Content Creation community. I&#39;d love to have information about servers, server staff, and more as I come to think of them.</li><li>This Blog. Well, I started it now, I guess. I just wanted to document things I learned so that I could come back to it someday, or someone else might find it ðŸ‘€. Not sure exactly what I want to do with it, so you&#39;ll just have to see. Obviously, it won&#39;t replace my personal, physical journal.</li><li>A Portfolio. No idea if I actually want to do this, but it might be cool if I&#39;m ever required to have a portfolio somewhere, I could list my proudest creations.</li></ul><p>As of now, those are the things that I can currently think of that I want to do, or am at least tossing around that idea. If I ever think of something else, I&#39;ll update the <code>README.md</code> file on the GitHub repository.</p><p>Getting this website rewrite to where it is now wasn&#39;t easy though. Yesterday, I decided to use VuePress v2, since it seemed most feature-packed and recent, knocking out VuePress v1 and VitePress. While mainly used for documentation and stuff, I felt like I liked the layout, and since everything looked way better than my old website, I decided to just adapt it anyway.</p>',6),n=(0,i.Uk)("It started out alright, I read the "),s={href:"https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/getting-started.html",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},r=(0,i.Uk)("Getting Started"),l=(0,i.Uk)(" and whatnot.
