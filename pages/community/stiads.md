> **Welcome to *So This Is A Discord Server :eyes:*!**

*So This Is A Discord Server :eyes:*, abbreviated *STIADS:eyes:*, is a Discord server where the primary focus is to hang out and have fun. And bully @cda94581#2410.  
Below contains the server rules and general information for the server. By being a member of this server, you agree to follow the rules.

> **Rules**

While the rules can be expanded into many more rules, there are only 4 main points.

â€¢ **Respect & Etiquette**  
We want to create and uphold a safe and caring environment for all to enjoy. Discrimination, harassment, bullying, and/or targeting, to name a few, will not be tolerated.  
In the name of respect, please avoid controversial topics such as politics or religion. Additionally, don't exploit loopholes; you're expected to follow the rules and the *spirit* of the rules.  
*If something is not explicitly stated, use your best judgement to determine what's right or wrong.*  
As stated earlier, harassment will not be tolerated. This includes negative interactions such as bullying for whatever reason.  
Furthermore, consistent pinging (`@<User>`) and/or ghost-pinging (Deleting a ping after sending), DMs, and other forms of potentially annoying actions is prohibited once asked to stop by other user.

â€¢ **Content & Media**  
Every post that you send, whether it be messages or any form of media, is subject to rules as well.  
First and foremost, this is a PG server. Graphical and/or vulgar content is prohibited.  
The sharing of hacks, exploits, pirated software, etc., is prohibited.  
Spam is prohibited. This includes the repeated posting of text, media, etc., as well as pointless messages that have no purpose other than to be an annoyance and cause a disruption. Random messages for the purpose of leveling is included in this.  
Please refrain from using any form of spoilers for movies, books, tv shows, etc., as this may ruin the enjoyment of such content for other members.  
Advertising is allowed in #media for online streams and videos. Discord server invites, offline streams, direct links to YouTube channels, and other content unrelated to *STIADS:eyes:* and its community, is prohibited and subject to removal.

â€¢ **Terms of Service**

â€¢ **Moderator Contact**  
If you would like to contact a moderator for non-urgent issues or direct questions, we have a system in place. Simply DM @STIADSðŸ‘€ Bot#9143 and include as much information as possible. Attach any files as needed. Please give time for the team to review and discuss each "ticket". All inquiries will be kept confidential.

â€¢ **Feedback**  
We encourage active feedback from all members of *STIADS:eyes:*. If you have any way this server can be improved, whether it's rules, activities, or anything else, feel free to let us know! You're free to publicly request in #feedback-suggestions or privately with the Moderator Contact information as listed above.

â€¢ **Modifications**  
Every week, assuming a certain @cda94581#2410 doesn't forget, we do a modification vote, where a member may opt to make a modification to any user with the @Modification Consent role. Modifications can be pfp changes, name changes, and others as well. The goal is to do this on Tuesdays, but it is flexible if needed. To submit, when submissions are open, you may DM @STIADSðŸ‘€ Bot#9143, be sure to start your message with Modification Submission. Attach files as needed, and if there is anything else to note, mention it in the message. If successful, you should get 2 responses saying "Message Sent!" (one for mod messaging). To vote, react with a :thumbsup: the one you want. When voting closes, the submission with the most votes wins. React to this message with a :thumbsup: to gain the @Modification Consent role.

â€¢ **Movie**  
Apparently people were talking about a movie, so the channels, #movie-script-discussion and #movie-script were created to discuss and write the script, respectively. Members with the @Movie Writers role will be given access. For fun ofc :p  
Check out #movie-script-discussion for information on applying for the role.

â€¢ **STIAMS**  
STIAMS is a Minecraft server in the works. As I'm lazy to work on this description, see #stiams-rules-info for more information.

â€¢ **Genders**  
We want to respect all members' genders, so we have Gender Roles you can get, to be sure we call you by the proper pronoun.
React to this message to get the roles:  
:male_sign: - @Gender: Male  
:female_sign: - @Gender: Female  
:three: - @Gender: They  
:four: - @Gender: All  
You can only have 1 at any given time. If would like multiple roles, please DM @STIADSðŸ‘€ Bot#9143.
