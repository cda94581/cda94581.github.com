::: warning NOTICE
The Campaign Series is a political story, and as such, real life political allies and enemies are included. I do not mean any offense to any country that has strained relationships with America, the location of the story. Furthermore, in the scope of American politics and politics abroad, I do not mean to offend or support any Republican, Democrat, Independent, Liberal, Conservative, or any other form of political allegiance that I am unaware of throughout this world. I wrote this for fun, and I hope everyone who reads this takes it for fun.
