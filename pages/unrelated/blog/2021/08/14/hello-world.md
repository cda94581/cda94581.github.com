# Hello, World!
Well, this is my first post, I guess. What am I supposed to say? Yesterday, I started migrating my old website over to a newer website, with much better everythings overall. Hopefully I actually finish writing this before tomorrow though, it's 11:29 PM right now.

Anyway, there's a ton that I want to do on this new website. A few of the things include:
- A Dedicated Tutorials & Videos Page. I'd love to be able to catalog and document each video, with all the necessary things to know, onto a webpage. I'll figure out more later on.
- A Community Tab. It would be wonderful to list some things going on in my Content Creation community. I'd love to have information about servers, server staff, and more as I come to think of them.
- This Blog. Well, I started it now, I guess. I just wanted to document things I learned so that I could come back to it someday, or someone else might find it :eyes:. Not sure exactly what I want to do with it, so you'll just have to see. Obviously, it won't replace my personal, physical journal.
- A Portfolio. No idea if I actually want to do this, but it might be cool if I'm ever required to have a portfolio somewhere, I could list my proudest creations.

As of now, those are the things that I can currently think of that I want to do, or am at least tossing around that idea. If I ever think of something else, I'll update the `README.md` file on the GitHub repository.

Getting this website rewrite to where it is now wasn't easy though. Yesterday, I decided to use VuePress v2, since it seemed most feature-packed and recent, knocking out VuePress v1 and VitePress. While mainly used for documentation and stuff, I felt like I liked the layout, and since everything looked way better than my old website, I decided to just adapt it anyway.

It started out alright, I read the [Getting Started](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/getting-started.html) and whatnot. However, I felt like the documentation was very incomplete, and didn't explain well enough. Also, I didn't feel like learning Vue either. Anyway, I started to attempt to make a YouTube Video Embed component, and was quite frustrated by how it always failed. I gave up and decided to go to bed, deciding that I would use VitePress tomorrow to see if I can get it to work, copying off of the [Bedrock OSS/Bedrock Wiki](https://github.com/bedrock-oss/bedrock-wiki) Repository.

The next day, I started work on it. After shedding many more tears, I finally got it to work. Right after that, I decided I still liked VuePress v2, so having *just* migrated to VitePress, I migrated it back to VuePress v2. This time it worked, and I finally got to start work on making more components and customizing it a bit more.

Much of the migration from the old website involved a lot of reformatting and rewriting as well, so the work wasn't easy. As of now, I've migrated most of the pages, as well as reformatting how they would present themselves, and now I have only the assets left to migrate. I decided to not only migrate the assets, but also add information on all the videos I've made public or unlisted, and so changed the file name to "videos.md", and laid out the framework.

I might work on the site tomorrow, mainly I'll just migrate the final information, consider launching it, and then continue to work on the videos information. However, I also want to take a break from this, so we'll see, I guess. I might just decide to start work on the Community section or something, we'll see.

I was going to add something else, but I forgot what I was going to say, so I'll end this here now. It's 11:48 PM now, and I managed to finish this before the end of the day, fortunately. Anyway, this was my first post, and I'll probably regret everything I wrote sometime into the future, because that's how much faith I have in myself.
