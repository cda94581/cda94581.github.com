# About

## cda94581
Hey, I'm cda94581, but you can call me cda! I am a hobby YouTuber, Twitch Streamer, Minecraft Add-on Developer, and programmer. Since uploading my [first video](https://youtu.be/kxaJZWS26l8) on January 20, 2020, I've had a ton of fun making videos and learning in the process. I believe in 100% total transparency, meaning anything that I ever use publicly will be provided to you in a form of a link or something so you can obtain it as well, obviously assuming the owner has publicified it. I make tutorials about making add-ons, and hope to expand to a lot more in the future. I have a second channel called cda9458 2, which uploads former streams from my Twitch account, as well as some occasional content that doesn't fit with the main channel.

## Feedback
Any and all feedback is welcome! I appreciate anything you have to say, from simple "Good job!"s to a more constructive cristicism. If you want me to know something to improve for the better for everyone, let me know! Even if it's a "You're bad", that still lets me know that I have work to do.

The best way to send me feedback is though my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/F3tWzxJfej), however any of the starred [links](#links) above are fine as well.
