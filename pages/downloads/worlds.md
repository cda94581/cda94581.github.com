> **Fully AFK Bartering Hall**
<YouTubeVideo id="KP-tcB3Pg04" />
An old video about making an AFK bartering hall with piglins. Apparently, I claimed it was the most overpowered and most AFK a bartering hall could get. Not my favorite video, but if you're still interested, you can still [download](https://github.com/cda94581/website-rewrite/blob/downloads/worlds/AFK%20Piglin%20Bartering%20Hall%20-cda.mcworld?raw=true) it.

> **Semi-AFK Bartering Hall**
<YouTubeVideo id="IIengtV2YGo" />
An old video about making an AFK bartering hall with piglins. Not really something I like or can be proud about, but I guess you can still [download](https://github.com/cda94581/website-rewrite/blob/downloads/worlds/Semi-AFK%20Bartering%20Hall%20-%20cda.mcworld?raw=true) it.
