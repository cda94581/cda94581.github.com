# Blog
Occasionally, I might want to write about something. This is just a place for me to store unrelated things that I learned, or anything I want to keep, but don't have a place to keep it for. I refuse to use other blogging sites though, so I'll use this.

Until I understand how to VuePress, this page will have to be manually updated with new blog links. Apologies in advance if I end up forgetting to add a link to a post.
