This page is a WIP.

Windows 10:
- [MCC Tool Chest](http://www.mcctoolchest.com/Download/file/MCCToolChestPE_Setup) (requires [VS 2015 C++ Runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145)) (Link is broken right now, creator seems to have abandoned this, and this doesn't work anymore.)
- [Universal Minecraft Editor](https://www.universalminecrafteditor.com/) also would've worked back when the video was released, but now it also doesn't work with the new chunk storage forma.
- [Amulet Editor](https://www.amuletmc.com/) is the only larger program that works for this tutorial, however the method of doing so is different, and it's slow. There are other smaller programs as well. I recommend checking out [this video](https://youtu.be/jZck5rC1TB8) for a tutorial on using Amulet.

Android:
- [Blocktopograph](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=rbq2012.blocktopograph), like MCC Tool Chest and Universal Minecraft Editor, would've worked back then, but has since been hidden from searches on the Google Play Store. This links still works however, but again, it doesn't support the new chunk storage format.
