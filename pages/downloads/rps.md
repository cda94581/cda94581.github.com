# Resource Packs
< [Back to "Downloads"](../downloads)

These are all the resource packs that I've created or used for various purposes.

## ChunkBounds - LinusDev
This is a chunk borders resource pack by LinusDev. This shows chunk borders in your Minecraft Bedrock World! This is useful for many farms, as you sometimes need to chunk align them. I also have this constantly on my [Blasting to Bedrock](../lets-plays#blasting-to-bedrock) world. The link for the pack can be found [here](https://mcpedl.com/chunkbounds-shaders).

::: warning Note
As of Windows 10 1.16.200+, shaders do not work, including chunk borders. You may be interested in trying out [MaddHatter's Chunk Pack](https://youtu.be/eTcxPQy1a90) or other similar packs instead.
