Members of this server are expected to follow and uphold the rules. Below is the general server rules and information, which can also be found in the [#rules-info](https://discord.com/channels/760613444323115018/760613526754164777) channel. Note that the rules may be revamped at any moment.

> **Welcome to *So This Is A Discord Server :eyes:***

This is a server in which we have fun and do things because we're bored. Like any server, we have rules in place to ensure a great time in our server. Please take a moment to read the following server rules and general information

> **Server Rules**

1. **Be Respectful**: We want to create and uphold a safe and caring environment for all to enjoy, and your behavior should reflect it. Harrassment, bullying, targeting, etc, will not be tolerated. Please avoid controversial topics, such as politics or religion. Do not find loopholes to get around certain things
*If something is not explicitly stated, use your best judgement to determine what's right and what's wrong.*
2. **Nothing Explicit or Inappropriate**: This is a PG server. Do not post any graphical or vulgar content. Requesting of overly graphical and/or vulgar songs is prohibited. Furthermore, sharing if hacks, exploits, pirated software, etc, is prohibted. Limit your use of language.
3. **No Harrassment**: This includes, but is not limited to, bullying, targeting, discrimination due to race, color, gender, sex, sexual orientation, etc. These are all prohibted. Furthermore, consistent pinging (`@<user>`) and ghost-pinging (Ping then removing it), DMs, etc, when asked to stop, are prohibited.
4. **No Spam**: Spam, the repeated posting of messages, media, song lyrics, copy pasta, etc, is prohibited.
5. **Watch Spoilers**: While we may be eager to talk about that latest hit, we must respect the fact that others who want to see it, may have not seen it yet, and talking about it may ruin the experience. Please give a considerable amount of time after the release before diving deeper, and even then, be careful not to divulge too deep.
6. **Advertisement**: You are allowed to post your own content (videos, streams, etc) in #media. Posting of Discord Server Invites, Direct Channel Links, Offline Streaming Channels, and other things not related to *So This Is A Discord Server 👀* and this server, are subject to removal.
7. **Follow the Discord ToS**: Like the Federal Laws of the US, the Discord Terms of Service is the supreme set of rules that all must follow. *Please note you must be at least 13, or older in some countries, to use Discord.* Read the full terms at [https://dis.gd/terms](https://dis.gd/terms)
8. **Have Fun**: This server is a more relaxed server, created for the purpose of having fun. So we hope you have a great time with the members of this server.

> **Feedback**

We'd love to hear all your feedback! Whether it is rules, new activities, etc, we want to know what you think!
Please let us know these thoughts in #feedback-suggestions

> **Modifications**

We are experimenting with an "anyone can submit, and people vote" style of modifications.
Members may also select other people to change their identity (nickname, pfp, status, etc), as long as they have consented prior to allow modifications.
Like previously, these modifications are on Tuesday of the following week, for 1 day. This is flexible if needed.

To submit, when submissions are open, you may DM @STIADS👀 Bot#9143 and be sure to start your message with Modification Submission. Attach files as needed, and if there is anything else to note, mention it in the message.
If successful, you should get 2 responses saying "Message Sent!" (one for mod messaging).
To vote, react with a 👍 the one you want. When voting closes, the submission with the most votes wins.

React to this message with a 👍 to gain the @Modification Consent role.

> **Movie**

Apparently people were talking about a movie, so the channels, #movie-script-discussion and #movie-script were created to discuss and write the script, respectively. Members with the @Movie Writers role will be given access. For fun ofc :p Currently looking for ideas for how I hand this role out, plus a potential color for this

> **Genders**

We want to respect all members' genders, so we have Gender Roles you can get, to be sure we call you by the proper pronoun.
React to this message to get the roles:
- :male_sign: - @Gender: Male
- :female_sign: - @Gender: Female
- :three: - @Gender: They
- :four: - @Gender: Other

You can only have 1 at any given time.

> **Enjoy the Server!**
