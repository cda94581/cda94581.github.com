If you just send me a friend request without us having any prior background or context together, chances are, you&#39;ll be that group. My criteria for acceptance is simple:</p><ul><li>I have had a least a few interactions with you</li><li>Most/all those interactions have been positive</li><li>I&#39;ve enjoyed the interactions</li><li>Please. Don&#39;t just interact with me.</li><li>Interactions with others should be positive</li></ul><p>If these criteria are met, I may accept.</p><p>Discord is slightly different. All the criteria above apply, however if you&#39;ve tried to send me a friend request there, chances are you&#39;ve noticed that I&#39;ve blocked them. Personally, I believe DMs are enough to get by, and that friend requests aren&#39;t necessary. However, if you really want it, ask me.
