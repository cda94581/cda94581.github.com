# Let's Plays
From time to time, I might do a let's play for Minecraft. This page stands as a link to direct you to some information about them.

## Blasting to Bedrock

Blasting to Bedrock is an idle series, where the goal is to mine to bedrock, chunk by chunk. The last time this was played was during Season 0. A video hasn't been made in quite a while, so this series is now classified as idle, but not necessarily over. All videos related to it, except for [Episode 7](https://youtu.be/DwC3wwHg7Lw), have been [unlisted](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLY2Ab8ZVEQnSTcWNj9EfNBWEyyjpzBAsZ).

### Stats
- Start date: Wednesday, April 22, 2020 (As Season 1)\*
- End date: N/A (As Season 0)\*
- 1.14.60 seed: -574766403
- Claimed chunks: 9
- Latest Claimed chunk: "Spawn"
- \*On June 9, 2020, I released a [video](https://youtu.be/1BgSL4yQSwI) announcing the season, which was formerly Season 1, would be changed to Season 0. Unfortunately, I have since removed that video.

### Rules
#### General
- After spawning in, you can only place blocks in the chunk in which you spawned.
- You can place blocks only in "claimed" chunks (or spawn, to an extent). To claim, you must destroy all the blocks, minus Bedrock and a few other special blocks.
- Once you mine the 8 chunks around the spawn chunk, the spawn chunk must then be destroyed.
- Spawners do not have to be destroyed.
- If there is an infinite water source in the chunk, you may remove all other blocks, then place blocks to remove the water. Those blocks also then must be destroyed.
- You may not mine ores in unclaimed chunks.
- You need to claim 9 chunks to be eligible for the Nether, and 25 overworld + 9 nether chunks for the End.

#### Nether
- You may mine from **Y 64** to **Y 0**, then place blocks to mine from **Y 64** to **Y 128**. The blocks placed must then be destroyed again to claim the chunk.
- The chunk(s) where the first portal generates may be left as is, until all surrounding chunks have been mined.

#### End
- You may place blocks in the Main Island until the Dragon is dead.
- You may place blocks in the chunk(s) where the portal is, until all surrounding chunks are mined.
