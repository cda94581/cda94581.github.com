## cda94581
Hey, I'm cda94581, but you can call me cda! I am a hobby YouTuber, Twitch Streamer, Minecraft Add-on Developer, and programmer. Since uploading my [first video](https://youtu.be/kxaJZWS26l8) on January 20, 2020, I've had a ton of fun making videos and learning in the process. I believe in 100% total transparency, meaning anything that I ever use publicly will be provided to you in a form of a link or something so you can obtain it as well, obviously assuming the owner has publicified it. I make tutorials about making add-ons, and hope to expand to a lot more in the future. I have a second channel called cda9458 2, which uploads former streams from my Twitch account, as well as some occasional content that doesn't fit with the main channel.

Below is a collection of my social links where you can get ahold of me, assuming I'm not dead on that platform and I actually check it. Links marked with a star :star: are a preferred method of contact, as they are the best places I can help you in.

## Friend Request Policy
I have a policy when it comes to friend requests. Anyone is free to send me friend requests, however not everyone will be accepted. If you just send me a friend request without us having any prior background or context together, chances are, you'll be that group. My criteria for acceptance is simple:

- I have had a least a few interactions with you
- Most/all those interactions have been positive
- I've enjoyed the interactions
- Please. Don't just interact with me.
- Interactions with others should be positive

If these criteria are met, I may accept.

Discord is slightly different. All the criteria above apply, however if you've tried to send me a friend request there, chances are you've noticed that I've blocked them. Personally, I believe DMs are enough to get by, and that friend requests aren't necessary. However, if you really want it, ask me. If criteria is met, I'll open up friend requests so you can send it.

## Feedback
Any and all feedback is welcome! I appreciate anything you have to say, from simple "Good job!"s to a more constructive cristicism. If you want me to know something to improve for the better for everyone, let me know! Even if it's a "You're bad", that still lets me know that I have work to do.

The best way to send me feedback is though my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/F3tWzxJfej), however any of the starred [links](#links) above are fine as well.
