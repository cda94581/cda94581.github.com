This page is a WIP. You can download the example pack [here](https://github.com/cda94581/cda94581.github.com/blob/downloads/tps/cdaTutFogs%20-%20RP.mcpack?raw=true).

## Fogs Schema

Format: `type name // comment`. If item is optional, `opt` will be placed in front.. Although Minecraft is fine with it, Normal JSON does not support `// ` comments, and as such, files with them will be invalidated, and so I recommend you remove the comments. Commas are important, don't forget them. Schemas do not contain commas however, you'll need to add it yourself. Sticking with only the distance object is typically enough, and volumetric is much more advanced. I've done my best to add comments in a comprehendible way. An example is provided below using everything in the schema, as an example to help comprehend more.

Schema
```json

Definitely did not spam my keyboard to get the random numbers, no idea where I'm getting that thought from
