I am a hobby YouTuber, Twitch Streamer, Minecraft Add-on Developer, and programmer. Since uploading my <a href="https://youtu.be/kxaJZWS26l8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first video</a> on January 20, 2020, I&#39;ve had a ton of fun making videos and learning in the process. I believe in 100% total transparency, meaning anything that I ever use publicly will be provided to you in a form of a link or something so you can obtain it as well, obviously assuming the owner has publicified it. I make tutorials about making add-ons, and hope to expand to a lot more in the future. I have a second channel called cda9458 2, which uploads former streams from my Twitch account, as well as some occasional content that doesn&#39;t fit with the main channel.</p><h2 id="links"><a class="header-anchor" href="#links" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Links</h2><p>Below is a collection of my social links where you can get ahold of me, assuming I&#39;m not dead on that platform and I actually check it. Links marked with a star ⭐ are a preferred method of contact, as they are the best places I can help you in.</p><ul><li><a href="https://youtube.com/cda94581" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Main YouTube Channel</a></li><li><a href="https://youtube.com/channel/UCAM79pxSAlMCBLSOh6UHqhw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Second YouTube Channel</a></li><li><a href="https://twitch.tv/cda94581" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitch</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/cda94581" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">⭐ Twitter</a></li><li><a href="https://discord.gg/F3tWzxJfej" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">⭐ Discord Server</a></li><li><a href="https://discord.gg/byxaSZr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">⭐ Alternative, Random, and not Content Related Discord Server</a></li><li><a href="https://cda94581.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Website (Probably WIP, and you&#39;re right here right now)</a></li><li><a href="https://cda94581.github.io/website-legacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Legacy Website</a></li><li><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/cda94581" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ancient Website</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/cda94581" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github</a></li><li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/cda94581" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scratch</a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok.com/@cda94581" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a></li></ul><h2 id="friend-request-policy"><a class="header-anchor" href="#friend-request-policy" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Friend Request Policy</h2><p>I have a policy when it comes to friend requests. Anyone is free to send me friend requests, however not everyone will be accepted. If you just send me a friend request without us having any prior background or context together, chances are, you&#39;ll be that group. My criteria for acceptance is simple:</p><ul><li>I have had a least a few interactions with you</li><li>Most/all those interactions have been positive</li><li>I&#39;ve enjoyed the interactions</li><li>Please. Don&#39;t just interact with me.</li><li>Interactions with others should be positive</li></ul><p>If these criteria are met, I may accept.</p><p>Discord is slightly different. All the criteria above apply, however if you&#39;ve tried to send me a friend request there, chances are you&#39;ve noticed that I&#39;ve blocked them. Personally, I believe DMs are enough to get by, and that friend requests aren&#39;t necessary. However, if you really want it, ask me. If criteria is met, I&#39;ll open up friend requests so you can send it.</p><h2 id="feedback"><a class="header-anchor" href="#feedback" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Feedback</h2><p>Any and all feedback is welcome! I appreciate anything you have to say, from simple &quot;Good job!&quot;s to a more constructive cristicism. If you want me to know something to improve for the better for everyone, let me know! Even if it&#39;s a &quot;You&#39;re bad&quot;, that still lets me know that I have work to do.</p><p>The best way to send me feedback is though my <a href="https://discord.gg/F3tWzxJfej" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord server</a>, however any of the starred <a href="#links">links</a> above are fine as well.</p>',14)];o.render=function(t,r,o,i,l,s){return e(),a("div",null,n)};export{r as __pageData,o as default};
